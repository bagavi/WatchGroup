 * We need to keep seperate table for deleted pages because , if we keep the deleted pages
 * in the main watchgroup table, the queries will get costilier as user uses the watchgroup.
 *
 * 		Database model
 * 		TABLE : watchgroup_deleted
 * 		----------------------------------------------------------------
 * 		|	wg_user		|	wg_title	|	wg_group	|
 * 		----------------------------------------------------------------

 * 		|			|			|			|
 * 		|			|			|			|
 * 		----------------------------------------------------------------
 * 		wg_user 	= 	User_Id
 * 		wg_title	=	title of the page
 * 		wg_group	=	Watch group id of the user
 *
 * What does this Specialpage do?
 * This displays all the pages which the user has deleted from his watchlist
 *
 * Currently i have given a basic code structure for this class,
 * more features and options to be included during the Planning Time
