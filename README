This is a prototype of the Extension:WatchGroup

I have created all the basic neccassary classes, but i have coded only few of them

Classes which I have coded
Main Class
	1)'WatchGroup/WatchGroup.php' ;
Hooks
	2)'WatchGroup/WatchGroup.hooks.php' ;

Special
	3)'WatchGroup/special/SpecialWatchGroup.php' ;
		Displays all the groups og the user.
		Allows him to add groups
	4)'WatchGroup/special/SpecialWatchParticularGroup.php' ;
		Displays all the pages in a particular group
	5)'WatchGroup/special/SpecialEditWatchGroup.php' ;
		Allows user to remove groups from list of WatchGroups
	
Action
	6)'WatchGroup/WatchedGroupItem.php' ;
	7)'WatchGroup/action/WatchGroupAction.php' ;
	
SQL
	8)'WatchGroup/sql/WatchGroup.sql' ;



Working features

1)New groups can be created
2)Pages can be added to each groups by "action=watchgroup&groupname=<groupname>
3)Pages can be removed to each groups by "action=unwatchgroup&groupname=<groupname>


Currently working on API
	'WatchGroup/api/ApiQueryWatchGroup.php' ;
	
I have left out Validation for the prototype.
For example, duplication of groupnames,pages etc.
